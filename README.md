# Introduction to Project

Alzheimerâ€™s disease is a very complex and degenerative disorder commonly associated with the 
elderly population. It affects the brain causing deep-rooted physical and mental behavioral problems that 
only worsen as time progresses. It is an irreversible condition and thus far affects a large part of the 
population. It can cause memory loss, decline in cognitive function, and severe changes in behavior. 
It is a very aggressive form of dementia. It is caused by an excess of protein in the brain. With the 
overload of these proteins, neurons in the brain begin to degenerate causing much atrophy of the brain. 
Over the century, even with medical advancements, the cause and underlying factors of this degenerative 
disease remains a mystery to medical professionals. This scientific approach to the disease will in hopes 
shed light upon the concerns of this aggressive form of dementia. This paper aims to provide an overview 
of the possible contributing factors to this disease. We have recorded data from two differing states to 
provide correlation factors between the two sets. Proposed questions, lifestyle choices, medical treatment 
availability, and other risk assessments were implemented to further facilitate usable and clean results. 
Using the provided dataset and the sources we pulled from the CDC, our methods of questioning and data 
manipulation have revealed interesting points and correlations with the disease and lifestyle factors. With 
the information and data manipulation tools stated above, our findings have been documented and 
reviewed for the following representation.
